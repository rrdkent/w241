title: "Reintroduction to R, RStudio, and Notebooks"
---

One of the 'off-label' goals of this course is making you *very* comfortable thinking about data in a structured way, and manipulating data in a structured way.

With this course, virtually all of our data *could*, in principle, be wrangled in a calculator. No TF necessary here, because we're structuring the comparisons we want to observe *by design* rather than by brute force computation. 

Rather than pointing the fire-hose at you (as we will do in ML, storage and retreival, and ML@S) we're giving you a gentle introduction. Don't mistake this for an opportunity not to develop your skills.

So, here we go. 

# Meta Instruction: RStudio

Head to [this page](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-1.html) and do the following: 

- Watch the short (1 minute  video)
- Read the Introduction, How it Works, Code Chunks, and Inline code sections 
- Come back here and keep working down the worksheet. 

What you're reading right now is an RStudio notebook -- just a slight turn on the notebook format that you're familiar with in a jupyter notebook. In these notebooks, the default is that you're writing into the "paper", or "markdown" space. But, if you want to incldue a code chunk, you can. [This file](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/rstudio-IDE-cheatsheet.pdf) has a cheatsheet for navigating the Rstudio IDE. 

In the upper right of this editor, you can see the **Insert** button. This has options for inserting a code chunk, in the language of your choice: R, bash, python, etc. Since for most of the class, we're going to be working in R, you may as well know the keyboard binding to this: 

- On a Mac: `option+command+i` -- to insert a code chunk. 
- On a PC and *nix: `control+alt+i` will accomplish the same thing. 

Go ahead an insert a chunk below, and include a call for a "Hello World String". 

<!-- Insert Chunk Below Here -->
```{r}
"Hello World string"
```


Note that you don't have to call for a print call surrounding a character string. The default behavior is going to be a print statement if you aren't assigning the results into an object. 

Notice that once you insert a code chunk, you get some options: 

- A downward pointing arrow with a bar -- will run all code to that point in the document
- A rightward facing arrow -- will run all code inside that chunk. 

Here are the keyboard bindings that you're going to use most frequently, and [here](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200711853-Keyboard-Shortcuts) is the full list of the keyboard bindings. 

- Run a line or selection: `command+Enter` or `control+Enter`
- Run a chunk: `option+command+c` or `control+alt+c`

Now, on to the work we're after, reminding ourselves about the `R` language.
