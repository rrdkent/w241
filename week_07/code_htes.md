# Do a Longer Hike! 
I know that this is a little bit in the middle of a number of tasks:

- David Reiley is lecturing
- You're reading
- You're taking quizzes, *and* 
- Now I'm asking you to code. 

If this is too much to do all at once, then feel free to come back to this later. 

If you want to code now, though, head [here](http://datahub.berkeley.edu/hub/user-redirect/git-pull?repo=https://github.com/UCB-MIDS/w241&branch=master&urlpath=rstudio) and navigate to `week_07>code_htes.Rmd` to work on an exercise.
