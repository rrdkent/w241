# Do a Longer Hike! 

Head [here](http://datahub.berkeley.edu/hub/user-redirect/git-pull?repo=https://github.com/UCB-MIDS/w241&branch=master&urlpath=rstudio) and navigate to `week_05>regression_analysis_notebook.Rmd` to work on an exercise.

Note! You're likely going to have to install some libraries to conduct this. As you run into errors, you can install one-by-one to build the environment. Perhaps this is a bit annoying, but (a) installing packages using the `install.packages("foo")` is a core capability that you should have; and (b) we don't have rights to write into your personal space!

Note that you should be able to compile this to a PDF, and also conduct all the steps of this anlaysis inside the datahub compute environment.
